# Electronics Container Module

- 3D models created in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).

- Aim of this project was to create a storage for electrical components, like resistors, capacitors, microcontrolers, etc.
Containers are made as a single unit that can be connected together to make a shelf of desired width and height.

- There are 3 main components to create one instance:
  - Container itself
  - Drawer
  - Drawer space separators (optional)
